## CREDITS ##

Many people have contributed to the sound design of Red Eclipse over the years.
starting with xJoJox and Quin. Some of these sounds still remain in the game to
this day.

Over time, people have tweaked or replaced certain sounds over the years to more
suit the evolving nature of the project, the greatest of whom is Q009 who has
totally revamped the sound feel of the game since version 2.0.

With the creation of the Corroder and Janitors, garsipal has helped ensure that
these new creations get the sounds that bring them to life immediately for everyone
to enjoy.

With music, you will find tracks by both xJoJox and EG music. I have always tried
to make sure the music of the game feels both sci fi yet old school nostaglic.
These people have been excellent team players in creating a unique soundtrack
that is just for Red Eclipse.

Of course, without these people and many more, Red Eclipse would be a silent wasteland.
